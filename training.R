# This is an example script to train your model given the (cleaned) input dataset.
# 
# This script will not be run on the holdout data, 
# but the resulting model model.joblib will be applied to the holdout data.
# 
# It is important to document your training steps here, including seed, 
# number of folds, model, et cetera

train_save_model <- function(cleaned_df, outcome_df) {
  # Trains a model using the cleaned dataframe and saves the model to a file.
  
  # Parameters:
  # cleaned_df (dataframe): The cleaned data from clean_df function to be used for training the model.
  # outcome_df (dataframe): The data with the outcome variable (e.g., from PreFer_train_outcome.csv or PreFer_fake_outcome.csv).
  
  ## This script contains a bare minimum working example
  set.seed(111) # not useful here because logistic regression deterministic
  
  # Combine cleaned_df and outcome_df
  model_df <- merge(cleaned_df, outcome_df, by = "nomem_encr", all.y=TRUE)  %>% select(-c(nomem_encr))
  
  # Random forest model 
  # model <- randomForest(new_child ~ ., data = model_df, ntree=1000, proximity=TRUE)
  model <- randomForest(new_child ~ ., data = model_df, proximity=TRUE, na.action=na.roughfix)
  
  # Save the model
